## Projects
A detailed showcase of the projects I've worked on, demonstrating my ability to solve business problems through data analysis.

### Project 1: Call Centre Interaction Analysis Using SQ. [SQL] [CODE](https://github.com/alexandramorajara/MyProjects/blob/main/Projects/SQL/Calls_SQL.sql)

This code sample represents one of the SQL queries I utilized in my role as a Data Analyst for a company operating a call center. The query was designed to extract and process data for subsequent analysis using Power BI. To maintain confidentiality and protect sensitive information, I've modified several data points. This ensures the privacy of the company's actual data while still demonstrating the structure and logic of the original query.

The altered version preserves the essence of the analysis performed, showcasing my SQL skills and approach to data extraction, without compromising any proprietary information.

**Skills:** SQL, Data Analysis, Data Manipulation.

**Status:**  Completed in September 2024.
